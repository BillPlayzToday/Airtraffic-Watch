# Airtraffic Watch
## What's this?
This project mainly focuses on remaking the flight radar interface, for educational purposes on how to process JSON data [flightradar24.com](https://www.flightradar24.com/).
## Hosted Example
You can find a live hosted example on my website at [this](https://billplayz.de/page/airtraffic/) location.
## How to install
You'll have to write your own backend for the page to properly work on your self-hosted webpage, but for tests, feel free to use the addresses I have written down in the code, which aren't very fast though.
The content in the page folder doesn't need too much to run except one module you can download [here](https://github.com/openlayers/openlayers/releases/tag/v6.15.1) (v6.15.1 is the version I've used).
## Disclaimer
This is just for educational purposes only, the Terms of Service of FlightRadar24 AB do restrict use of their APIs and threaten you with revoked access to FlightRadar24, which will NOT apply to users of the page, instead it will apply to the server that collects the FlightRadar24 data and distributes it to the clients.
We are simply taking data from the internet (public resource) and revisualizing it.
